# CloudTierSDK
A storage tiering example was implemented with CloudTier Storage Tiering SDK. The CloudTier Storage Tiering SDK provides you a simple solution to develop the cloud archiving software, it allows you to integrate your existing on-premises applications with the remote cloud storage infrastructure in a seamless, secure, and transparent fashion. The cloud tiering is a data storage technique which automatically moves data between high-cost on-premise storage and low-cost remote cloud storage, it provides a native cloud storage tier, it allows you to free up on-premise storage capacity, by moving out cooler data to the cloud storage, thereby reducing capital and operational expenditures.
